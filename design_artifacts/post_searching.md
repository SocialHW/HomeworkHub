###Post Searching

In order to aid users in navigating the site, we will provide a searching feature. There
will be a text box located in the header of the page, where users (who do not need to be
logged in) can enter a string of text and hit enter to see the results. The search will
return results that include any of the words in the query in the title, and present
them in a vertical listing. 

It should not be allowed to use punctuation such as ;, in order to avoid SQL injection.
